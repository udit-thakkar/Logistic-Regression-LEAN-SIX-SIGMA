*Replace Minitab with Python to perform a Logistic Regression to estimate the minimum bonus needed to reach 75% of a productivity target*

Lean Six Sigma (LSS) is a method based on a stepwise approach to process improvements.This approach usually follows 5 steps 
(Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control) for improving existing process problems with unknown causes.

We will implement Logistic Regression with Python to estimate the impact of a daily productivity bonus on your warehouse operators picking productivity.

### Scenario
You are Reginal Director of a Logistic Company (3PL) and you have 22 warehouses in your scope.

In each warehouse, the site manager has fixed a picking productivity target for the operators; your objective is to find the right incentive policy to reach 75% of this target.
P.S: Picking Productivity is defined by the number of cartons picked per hour paid.

### Objective: find the right incentive policy
Currently, productive operators (operators that reach their daily productivity target) receive 5 euros per day in addition to their daily salary of 64 euros (after-tax).
However, this incentive policy applied in 2 warehouses is not that effective; only 20% of the operators are reaching this target.
#### Question
What should be the minimum daily bonus needed to reach 75% of the picking productivity target?
#### Experiment
Randomly select operators in your 22 warehouses
#### Implement a daily incentive amount varying between 1 to 20 Euros
Check if the operators reached their target
